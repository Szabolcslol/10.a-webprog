      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Szabolcs, your friendly neighborhood web wizard. My journey into the world of web development started when I realized that if I could write a few lines of code, I could make things appear on the internet! Naturally, I thought, "This is basically magic," and I was hooked.</p>
      <p>As a self-taught wizard (a.k.a. web developer), I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—like a good apprentice should. Now, I can summon websites from the depths of my code editor and make them come to life on any device, at any time. (Okay, maybe not literally summon them... but you get the idea.)</p>
      <p>I believe every project should be a little bit of an adventure. When I take on a new challenge, I treat it like a treasure hunt: I dig deep, solve puzzles, and emerge victorious with a shiny new website (or app) ready to impress. Along the way, I’ve learned that the best tools aren’t just the ones I use, but the weird, wacky ideas I stumble upon during late-night coding sessions and endless coffee breaks.</p>
      <p>When I am not busy casting "Code-Completion" spells or debugging mysterious errors, I enjoy reading about the latest tech trends, creating designs that make people smile, and maybe... getting a little too excited about the perfect CSS property.</p>
      <p>So, if you are looking for someone who’s part coder, part wizard, and all-around creative thinker, you have found the right person. Let’s make some magic together!</p>
